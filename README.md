# Housing affordability in Austria


## Introduction & Goal 

According to the Property Index study, 2022 of Deloitte, homeownership in Austria is increasingly becoming a luxury good.  [1]   [2]  

Since the end of 2020, residential prices in Austria have risen by double digits, most recently by more than ten percent by the end of 2021. These prices are fueled by the highest inflation since the early 1980s and negative real interest rates on bonds. 
With all this in mind, the goal of this Storymap is to analyze the housing statistics of Austria to give an overview of how expensive it is to buy or build your own home. Additionally, rental costs will be analyzed to show alternatives to homeownership in Austria.


## Methods

### Data sources: 
For this Storymap data from Statistik Austria [3] as well as bodenpreise.at [4] were used. 


### Data preprocessing: 
For preprocessing of the data Python was used in detail the pandas package. The pandas package in Python provides tools for working with data, including preprocessing. The package includes functions for reading data from various file formats, such as CSV, Excel, and SQL databases. It also includes tools for cleaning and transforming data, such as filling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types. Additionally, pandas provides functions for working with dates and times, as well as tools for merging, joining, and grouping data.

Since the data that is provided by Statistik Austria and bodenpreise.at was not in the right form for visualizing it the functionalities of pandas were used to bring it into the right format.


### Data visualization
For visualizing the preprocessed data ARCGIS online as well as the Python packages matplotlib and seaborn were used.
